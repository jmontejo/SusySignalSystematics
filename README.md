# SusySignalSystematics

Parameterization of SUSY signal systematics independently of the decay

# Derive systematics
Need a script that extracts the variations out of a sample. The variations are stored as histograms or functions, as a function of (process, mass)

# Apply systematics
Second script that returns those variations, interpolated over mass if needed
